DESCRIPTION
    This module subclasses the DBI to provide improvements and greater
    flexibility in the following areas:

    * Parameter placeholders and data binding

    * Data retrieval and processing

    * Accessing and interacting with datasources

  Parameter placeholders and data binding
    This module provides support for a wider range of parameter placeholder
    and data-binding schemes. As well as continued support for the simple
    positional placeholders ("?"), additional support is provided for
    numeric placeholders (":N" and "?N"), and named placeholders (":NAME"
    and @NAME).

    As for the process of binding data values to parameters: that is, by
    default, now completely automated, removing a significant part of the
    workload from the prepare-bind-execute cycle. It is, however, possible
    to swtch off automatic data-binding globally and on a
    statement-by-statement basis.

    The following familiar operations have been modified to accommodate all
    of these changes, though developers continue to use them as they always
    have done:

    * "$DATABASE_HANDLE->prepare($STATEMENT, \%ATTR);"

    * "$DATABASE_HANDLE->do($STATEMENT, \%ATTR, @DATA);"

    * "$STATEMENT_HANDLE->bind_param($NAME_OR_POSITION, $VALUE, \%ATTR);"

    * "$STATEMENT_HANDLE->execute(@DATA);"

  Data retrieval and processing
    Four new methods, each available for database and statement handles,
    have been implemented:

    * "processrow_arrayref"

    * "processrow_hashref"

    * "processall_arrayref"

    * "processall_hashref"

    These methods complement DBI's existing fetch methods, providing new
    ways to retrieve and process data.

  Accessing and interacting with datasources
    The module's "-subs" import option may be used to create subroutines,
    during the compile phase, and export them to the caller's namespace for
    use later as representations of database and statement handles.

    * Use for connecting to datasources

          use DBIx::FlexibleBinding -subs => [ 'MyDB' ];

          # Pass in any set of well-formed DBI->connect(...) arguments to associate
          # your name with a live database connection ...
          #
          MyDB( 'dbi:mysql:test;host=127.0.0.1', '', '', { RaiseError => 1 } );

          # Or, simply pass an existing database handle as the only argument ...
          #
          MyDB($dbh);

    * Use them to represent database handles

          use DBIx::FlexibleBinding -subs => [ 'MyDB' ];
          use constant SQL => << '//';
          SELECT *
            FROM mapsolarsystems
           WHERE regional  = :is_regional
             AND security >= :minimum_security
          //

          MyDB( 'dbi:mysql:test;host=127.0.0.1', '', '', { RaiseError => 1 } );

          # If your name is already associated with a database handle then just call
          # it with no parameters to use it as such ...
          #
          my $sth = MyDB->prepare(SQL);

    * Use them to represent statement handles

          use DBIx::FlexibleBinding -subs => [ 'MyDB', 'solar_systems' ];
          use constant SQL => << '//';
          SELECT *
            FROM mapsolarsystems
           WHERE regional  = :is_regional
             AND security >= :minimum_security
          //

          MyDB( 'dbi:mysql:test;host=127.0.0.1', '', '', { RaiseError => 1 } );

          my $sth = MyDB->prepare(SQL);

          # Simply call the statement handle proxy, passing a statement handle in as
          # the only argument ...
          #
          solar_systems($sth);

    * Use to interact with the represented database and statement handles

          use DBIx::FlexibleBinding -subs => [ 'MyDB', 'solar_systems' ];
          use constant SQL => << '//';
          SELECT *
            FROM mapsolarsystems
           WHERE regional  = :is_regional
             AND security >= :minimum_security
          //

          MyDB( 'dbi:mysql:test;host=127.0.0.1', '', '', { RaiseError => 1 } );

          # retrieve the results ...
          #
          # Use the database handle proxy to prepare, bind and execute statements, then
          # retrieve the results ...
          #
          my $array_of_hashrefs = MyDB(SQL,
                                       is_regional => 1,
                                       minimum_security => 1.0);

                                       minimum_security => 1.0);

          # Using -subs also relaxes strict 'subs' in the caller's scope, so pretty-up
          # void context calls by losing the parentheses, if you wish to use callbacks
          # to process the results ...
          #
          MyDB SQL, is_regional => 1, minimum_security => 1.0, callback {
              printf "%-16s %.1f\n", $_->{solarSystemName}, $_->{security};
          };

          # You can use proxies to represent statements, too. Simply pass in a statement
          # handle as the only argument ...
          #
          my $sth = MyDB->prepare(SQL);
          solar_systems($sth);    # Using "solar_systems" as statement proxy.

          # Now, when called with other types of arguments, those argument values are
          # bound and the statement is executed ...
          #
          my $array_of_hashrefs = solar_systems(is_regional => 1,
                                                minimum_security => 1.0);

          # In list context, results come back as lists ...
          #
          my @array_of_hashrefs = solar_systems(is_regional => 1,
                                                minimum_security => 1.0);

          # Statements requiring no parameters cannot be used in this manner because
          # making a call to a statement proxy with an arity of zero results in the
          # statement handle being returned. In this situation, use something like
          # undef as an argument (it will be ignored in this particular instance) ...
          #
          my $rv = statement_proxy(undef);
          #
          # Meh, you can't win 'em all!

PACKAGE GLOBALS
  $DBIx::FlexibleBinding::AUTO_BINDING_ENABLED
    A boolean setting used to determine whether or not automatic binding is
    enabled or disabled globally.

    The default setting is "1" (*enabled*).

  $DBIx::FlexibleBinding::PROXIES_PROCESSALL_USING
    The subroutines created with the "-subs" import option may be used to
    retrieve result sets. By default, any such subroutines delegate that
    particular task to a method called "processall_hashref", which is
    provided by this module for both database and statement handles alike.

    For reasons of efficiency the developer may prefer array references over
    hash references, in which case they only need assign the value
    "processall_arrayref" to this global.

IMPORT TAGS AND OPTIONS
  -alias
    This option may be used by the caller to select an alias to use for this
    package's unwieldly namespace.

        use DBIx::FlexibleBinding -alias => 'DBIF';

        my $dbh = DBIF->connect('dbi:SQLite:test.db', '', '');

  -subs
    This option may be used to create subroutines, during the compile phase,
    in the caller's namespace to be used as representations of database and
    statement handles.

        use DBIx::FlexibleBinding -subs => [ 'MyDB' ];

        # Initialise by passing in a valid set of DBI->connect(...) arguments.
        # The database handle will be the return value.
        #
        MyDB 'dbi:mysql:test;host=127.0.0.1', '', '', { RaiseError => 1 };

        # Or, initialise by passing in a DBI database handle.
        # The handle is also the return value.
        #
        MyDB $dbh;

        # Once initialised, use the subroutine as you would a DBI database handle.
        #
        my $statement = << '//';
        SELECT solarSystemName AS name
          FROM mapsolarsystems
         WHERE security >= :minimum_security
        //
        my $sth = MyDB->prepare($statement);

        # Or use it as an expressive time-saver!
        #
        my $array_of_hashrefs = MyDB($statement, security => 1.0);
        my @system_names = MyDB($statement, minimum_security => 1.0, callback {
            return $_->{name};
        });
        MyDB $statement, minimum_security => 1.0, callback {
            my ($row) = @_;
            print "$row->{name}\n";
        };

    Use of this option automatically relaxes "strict 'subs'" for the
    remainder of scope containing the "use" directive. That is unless "use
    strict 'subs'" or "use strict" appears afterwards.

METHODS ("DBIx::FlexibleBinding")
  connect
        $dbh = DBIx::FlexibleBinding->connect($data_source, $username, $password);
        $dbh = DBIx::FlexibleBinding->connect($data_source,
                                              $username,
                                              $password,
                                              \%attr);

    Establishes a database connection, or session, to the requested
    data_source and returns a database handle object if the connection
    succeeds or undef if it does not.

    *Refer to <http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBI/DBI.pm#connect> for a more
    detailed explanation of how to use this method*.

METHODS ("DBIx::FlexibleBinding::db")
  do
        $rows = $dbh->do($statement_string);
        $rows = $dbh->do($statement_string, \%attr);
        $rows = $dbh->do($statement_string, \%attr, @bind_values);

        $rows = $dbh->do($statement_handle);
        $rows = $dbh->do($statement_handle, @bind_values);

    Prepare if necessary and execute a single statement. Returns the number
    of rows affected or undef on error. A return value of -1 means the
    number of rows is not known, not applicable, or not available.

    *Refer to <http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBI/DBI.pm#do> for a more
    detailed explanation of how to use this method*.

  prepare
        $sth = $dbh->prepare($statement_string);
        $sth = $dbh->prepare($statement_string, \%attr);

    Prepares a statement for later execution by the database engine and
    returns a reference to a statement handle object.

    *Refer to <http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBI/DBI.pm#prepare> for a more
    detailed explanation of how to use this method*.

                                                     @optional_callbacks);

    Prepares the statement if necessary, executes it with the specified data
    bindings, and fetches all the rows in the result set.

    Though presented initially as an array reference, the value of each row
    may be transformed, by the caller, with the aid of callbacks.

                                                    @optional_callbacks);

    Prepares the statement if necessary, executes it with the specified data
    bindings, and fetches all the rows in the result set.

    Though presented initially as a hash reference, the value of each row
    may be transformed, by the caller, with the aid of callbacks.

  processrow_arrayref *(Database Handles)*
        $value = $dbh->processrow_arrayref($statement_string,
                                           \%optional_attr,
                                           @optional_data_bindings,
                                           @optional_callbacks);

                                           @optional_callbacks);

    Prepares the statement (if necessary) and executes it immediately with
    the specified data bindings, and fetches one and only one row.

    Though presented initially as an array reference, the value of that row
    may be transformed, by the caller, with the aid of callbacks.

  processrow_hashref *(Database Handles)*
        $value = $dbh->processrow_hashref($statement_string,
                                          \%optional_attr,

                                          @optional_callbacks);

        $value = $dbh->processrow_hashref($statement_handle,
                                          @optional_data_bindings,
                                          @optional_callbacks);

    Prepares the statement (if necessary) and executes it immediately with
    the specified data bindings, and fetches one and only one row.

    Though presented initially as a hash reference, that value of that row
    may be transformed , by the caller, with the aid of callbacks.

METHODS ("DBIx::FlexibleBinding::st")
  auto_bind
        $sth->auto_bind($boolean);
        $state = $sth->auto_bind();

    Use this method to enable, disable or inspect the current state of
    automatic binding for a particular statement handle.

  bind
        $sth->bind(@bind_values);       # For positional and numeric placeholders
        $sth->bind(\@bind_values);      # For positional and numeric placeholders
        $sth->bind(%bind_values);       # For numeric and named placeholders
        $sth->bind(\%bind_values);      # For numeric and named placeholders
        $sth->bind([%bind_values]);     # For numeric and named placeholders

    The bind method associates (binds) the values supplied in the parameter
    list with the placeholders embedded in the prepared statement.

    With automatic binding enabled (and it is by default), any operation
    that results in a subsequent call to the "execute" method will almost
    certainly complete any parameter binding automatically using this
    method.

    With automatic binding disabled, this method will not be called at all
    and the execute method will almost dutifully convey bind values as they
    are presented up the DBI inheritance chain to the handler's execute
    method. *Almost dutifully* because a lone array reference will be
    de-referenced and passed up as a list. The general assumption here is
    that you won't present any bind values because the hard work of doing
    the "bind_param" calls has already been done, or a manual call to the
    "bind" method has already taken place.

    In any case, it's pretty hard to screw-up when relying on this method to
    bind your data values. Provided that what you present can be interpreted
    as a list of values for positional placeholders, a list of key-value
    pairs for named placeholders, or either for numeric placeholders, then
    you'll be absolutely fine.

  bind_param
        $sth->bind_param($param_num, $bind_value)
        $sth->bind_param($param_num, $bind_value, \%attr)
        $sth->bind_param($param_num, $bind_value, $bind_type)

        $sth->bind_param($param_name, $bind_value)
        $sth->bind_param($param_name, $bind_value, \%attr)
        $sth->bind_param($param_name, $bind_value, $bind_type)

    The "bind_param" method associates (binds) a value to a placeholder
    embedded in the prepared statement. The implementation provided by this
    module allows the use of parameter names, if appropriate, in addition to
    parameter positions.

    *Refer to <http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBI/DBI.pm#bind_param> for a more
    detailed explanation of how to use this method*.

  execute
        $rv = $sth->execute;
        $rv = $sth->execute(@bind_values);

    Perform whatever processing is necessary to execute the prepared
    statement. An undef is returned if an error occurs. A successful execute
    always returns true regardless of the number of rows affected, even if
    it's zero.

    *Refer to <http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBI/DBI.pm#execute> for a more
    detailed explanation of how to use this method*.

  processall_arrayref *(Statement Handles)*
        $array_of_values = $sth->processall_arrayref(@optional_callbacks);
        @array_of_values = $sth->processall_arrayref(@optional_callbacks);

    Fetches the entire result set.

    Though presented initially as an array reference, the value of each row
    may be transformed, by the caller, with the aid of callbacks.

  processall_hashref *(Statement Handles)*
        $array_of_values = $sth->processall_hashref(@optional_callbacks);
        @array_of_values = $sth->processall_hashref(@optional_callbacks);

    Fetches the entire result set.

    Though presented initially as an hash reference, the value of each row
    may be transformed, by the caller, with the aid of callbacks.

  processrow_arrayref *(Statement Handles)*
        $value = $sth->processrow_arrayref(@optional_callbacks);

    Fetches the next row of a result set if one exists.

    Though presented initially as an array reference, the value of that row
    may be transformed, by the caller, with the aid of callbacks.

  processrow_hashref *(Statement Handles)*
        $value = $sth->processrow_hashref(@optional_callbacks);

    Fetches the next row of a result set if one exists.

    Though presented initially as an hash reference, the value of that row
    may be transformed, by the caller, with the aid of callbacks.

EXPORTS
    The following symbols are exported by default:

  callback
    To enable the namespace using this module to take advantage of the
    callbacks, which are one of its main features, without the unnecessary
    burden of also including the module that provides the feature *(see
    Params::Callbacks for more detailed information)*.
