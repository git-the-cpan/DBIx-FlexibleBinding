    - Methods with names matching /^getall_.*$/ now have names starting 
      with "getrows_". I wasn't happy with "getall_" because, to those with
      less experience may be left wondering "get all what?" At least this is 
      a little more self explanatory.
      
    - $DBIx::FlexibleBinding::PROXIES_GETALL_USING is now simply
      $DBIx::FlexibleBinding::GETROWS_USING and is now also used by "getrows"
      methods.
      
    - $DBIx::FlexibleBinding::GETROW_USING has been introduced and is used by 
      "getrow" methods.
    
    - Database handles and statement handles now implement methods called "getrow"
      and "getrows" which do their thing by fetching rows as hashrefs by default,
      unless the caller change the following package globals:
      
        * $DBIx::FlexibleBinding::GETROW_USING
        * $DBIx::FlexibleBinding::GETROWS_USING
    
    - Functional Iterator pattern implemented with it's own for_each method.
    
    - Numerous POD changes with more example code added.
    
    - Numerous non-functional changes to some routines (local $_ moved to another
      scope in some places).
      
    - Tests made less noisey.
    
    - More test coverage, but there could always be more, more, more.

    - No functional changes; just refactoring to use Sub::Install instead of the
      shonky pattern I was using to squirrel my methods in others' namespaces.
    
    - # ABSTRACT: added

      with "getrow_".
    
    - Methods with names that match /^processall_.*$/ now have names beginning 
      with "getall_".

    - Guess who forgot to hide embedded packages from PAUSE?
